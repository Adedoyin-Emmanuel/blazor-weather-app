# Blazor Web App ðŸš€

This is a simple Blazor Web App that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the current weather of a country, city or location. I built this app to learn the Blazor framework and to practice my C# skills.

## Technologies Used ðŸ”§

1. Blazor
2. C#
3. Tailwindcss and Daisy UI
4. OpenWeatherMap API

## Resouces

I will add the resouces I used to learn Blazor and C# here.

1. Microsoft Blazor Docs <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-8.0&WT.mc_id=dotnet-35129-website>
2. Blazor Crash Course By Julio Casal <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBVIclt4sOo>

Those are the 2 major resouces I used to learn Blazor before building this app. If you've the funds to pay for Julio's course, I highly recommend it. They are solid.
